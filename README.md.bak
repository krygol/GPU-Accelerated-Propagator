# GPU-Accelerated-Propagator

The GPU Accelerated Propagator(GAP) was developed as part of my masters study at the University 
of Bergen (UiB). 
GAP is used to contruct a given Hamiltionian in an eigenstate basis and then propagate the
Hamiltionian in time. In the research group of atomic physics it is used to simulate laser Hydrogen
interactions. 

## Implementation 

GAP as a program is devided in four blocks. First a set of b-splines is generated. Then an
eigenstate basis is formed. The Hamiltionian is then built in this eigenstate basis. The time
evolution of the system is then done with the Lanczos propagator. 

GAP is implemented in C++ making extensive use of the Eigen library. 

## Parallelization 

The Hamiltionian is distributed with MPI. For the CPU accelerated versions openMP and the MKL are
used for inner node parallelism. 
For the GPU versions every MPI rank is matched to a GPU. 

## Depencies 

The code has been tested with the following version of the libraries:
- Eigen 3.3.5
- Lyra 
- CUDA 10.1
- MKL 2020.1.217 
- openMPI 4.0.2 (for the GPU version it has to be CUDA aware MPI)
Different versions of the libraries might work but were not tested.

The parameters given in the table above are run time parameters and can be set as command line
parameters using Lyra. The default parameters are in the InputParamter.h.
The Hamiltionian and the initial wave function have to be hardcoded into GAP.  

## Output
- fort.88 contains the the element wise square of the wavefunction
- fort.89 contains the wavefunction at the end of the the laserpulse

Further information on the functioning of GAP can be found in the thesis in 'doc'.
The thesis includes a performance study on GAP and a study of laser hydrogen interaction in the 800
nm regime.
